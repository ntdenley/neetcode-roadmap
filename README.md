# Neetcode.io Solutions: LeetCode Roadmap Problems

Welcome to my personal repository for [Neetcode.io's **LeetCode Roadmap**](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) solutions! This repository contains my implementations of various LeetCode problems in **C++** and **Python**, following the structure provided by Neetcode.io.

## Table of Contents

4. [Solutions Overview](#solutions-overview)

## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems organized by [Neetcode.io's curated roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Each problem is solved in either **C++** or **Python**, providing clean, efficient code implementations.

The goal of this repository is to not only serve as a personal resource for interview preparation but also to help others learn by sharing well-commented and optimized solutions. In this README file, I will be adding my own interpretations of each problem and the thought process behind each solution. While I know this project will certainly help me prepare for more technical programming challenges, I hope that it also serves as a helpful resource for those who want to learn more about the problem-solving process for these challenges.

## Structure

Each section of the roadmap will have it's own directory, which will be in the root of this project. For each section, there will be a folder for each problem I've started/completed, containing my solution.

## Solutions Overview
These are the sections of the roadmap, in the order I will most likely be completing them. If a section has been started by me, it will have a progress bar next to it, and it will link to a section outlining my solutions to the problems in that section that I've completed so far. If it has been completed, it will have a checkmark next to it.

### Arrays and Hashing

1. [Duplicate Integer](#duplicate-integer)

#### Duplicate Integer
Solved in C++

[Problem on Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/problems/duplicate-integer)

This problem involves checking if there is a duplicate integer in the given list of integers. At face value, this means we need to iterate through the list until we find a duplicate. At first, I considered creating a bucket for each number, then adding the integers into each bucket until one of them had more than one item, indicating a duplicate. After considering this, I decided it was likely unnecessary and overcomplicated for this problem. The solution I ended up going with was to sort the array using `std::sort`, then I could simply check for adjacent integers to see if there are duplicates. While this may not be the most time-efficient solution (since it requires sorting the whole list upfront), it meant that I wouldn't need to keep track of any intermediate data while parsing the list, such as what integers I've already seen.
